        <h2>Espresso</h2>
        <p>
          Espresso is a famous type of coffee from Italy. You make it by forcing high-pressure steam through grounded coffee beans. The final product is a thick coffee with a creamy foam on top. Due to its thickness and high level of caffeine per unit, it is often a base for other coffee drinks such as Americano.

        <p>
          Cappuccino also consists of espresso and milk. However, there are two types of milk here. The beverage contains 1/3 of espresso, 1/3 foamed milk, and 1/3 steamed milk. You can serve it iced, hot, with cream instead of milk, and in various other ways.

        <h2>Mochaccino</h2>
        <p>
          The Mochaccino is a variety of the caf√® latte (not the same thing, as many people surprisingly believe). It consists of a double espresso shot, foamed milk, and an additional flavor. Usually, the aroma comes from cocoa powder or chocolate syrup. If you want, you can add some cinnamon, whipped cream, or other toppings.
